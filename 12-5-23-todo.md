<!--

to do

on frontend

The calendar page must
pull up the workout from the clicked date

we might need an exercises page that allows a user to see stats
for specific exercises, like squat, deadlift, etc
the newworkout page could pull from the same bank

myworkouts page needs to pull the data and display it here
IMO bootstrap cards would be the simplest way to display this
